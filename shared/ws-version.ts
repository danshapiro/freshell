// Focused-episode-7 round 3 (Findings F1+F2): bumped 9 → 10 with the
// `panes.closed` batch envelope / `panes.closed.result` answer and the
// `pane.opened` durable open re-assertion. The client's whole-tab close gate
// awaits the batch answer, and a version-9 server that predates the frame's
// schema boundary DROPS unknown typed messages silently (the deserialization
// floor), so shipping the gated batch with no bump would let a mixed pair
// behave as though tab close evidence were recorded when it was not. The
// bump makes the mix fail LOUDLY instead: the strict hello check rejects
// mismatched sides with PROTOCOL_MISMATCH ("Please reload the page."), so a
// close is either confirmed by a server that knows the answer or the
// connection never pretends it can be — no silent exactness loss. (The
// hello check is symmetric: both peers enforce it in freshell-ws.)
//
// Focused-episode-7 round 5 (Finding F3) — NO bump for `pane.opened.result`:
// the re-assertion gained a correlated answer, but the client never GATES on
// it (its listen is bounded and non-blocking; the per-ready open sweep
// re-asserts every displayed pane regardless). A predated v10 server simply
// never sends the frame, and the mix degrades to exactly the behavior the
// sweep already heals — no wedge, no silent exactness loss beyond the
// already-shipped state. The bump rule applies to answers the client AWAITS
// (`pane.closed.result`, `panes.closed.result`): an awaited answer a
// predated server silently drops must never ship unversioned.
//
// Codex pane lifecycle (Task 13): bumped 10 → 11. `terminal.kill` may now
// name a still-starting pane by its createRequestId alone (no terminalId),
// and the server answers `terminal.killed` only once the pane's agent is
// confirmed Gone. The client awaits that answer for a terminalId-less kill
// with no deadline, and a version-10 server cannot parse a terminalId-less
// kill and silently drops it, so a mixed pair would leave the close waiting
// forever. The bump makes the mix fail LOUDLY instead: the strict hello check
// answers PROTOCOL_MISMATCH and the client shows its version-mismatch overlay.
// It therefore ships as server and client together in one full restart, never
// as a client-only deploy.
