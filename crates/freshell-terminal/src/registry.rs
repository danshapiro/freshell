//! Server-side terminal **registry** — the port of `server/terminal-registry.ts`
//! ownership model + the multi-client fan-out of `server/terminal-stream/broker.ts`,
//! reduced to the `mode:'shell'` path (`port/machine/specs/terminal-core.md` §1).
//!
//! ## Why this exists (the T3 breadth gap)
//!
//! In 3.4b a terminal was owned by the WS connection that created it: its PTY and
//! its produced `terminal.output` frames lived on the connection, streamed only to
//! that one socket, and were killed when it closed. That fails every
//! detach/attach/background-session flow — a *second* or *reconnected* socket has
//! no shared object to re-attach to (`multi-client`, `reconnection`, `tab-management`
//! hot-across-reload).
//!
//! This registry moves ownership off the connection: a terminal (PTY + its seq'd
//! replay log + geometry) is keyed by `terminalId` and outlives any socket. Per the
//! spec's state machine (`§1.2`):
//!
//! * **create** registers a running terminal (PTY spawned, no client attached yet).
//! * **attach** from ANY connection sends `terminal.attach.ready`, then **replays the
//!   scrollback** (frames with `seqStart > sinceSeq`) and streams live — the
//!   snapshot-on-attach + live handoff (`§3.5`, `broker.ts:312-610`).
//! * **detach / socket-close** removes that connection's subscription but leaves the
//!   PTY **running** — `detached ≡ clients.size === 0` while `running` (`§1.2`, the
//!   background session).
//! * **kill / exit** removes the terminal and sends `terminal.exit` to every
//!   attached connection (`§1.2`, `§6.3`).
//!
//! ## Concurrency (`§7`)
//!
//! Each terminal owns an `Arc<Mutex<TerminalShared>>` holding its replay log +
//! subscriber set. The PTY reader thread's sink ([`ingest`]) locks it to append one
//! frame and fan it out; an attach locks it to snapshot the replay set and register
//! the subscriber. Because both take the SAME per-terminal lock, an attach that
//! registers a subscriber and enqueues the replay while holding the lock guarantees
//! **replay-then-live** ordering with no gap and no duplicate across the handoff
//! (the reader can't append until the attach releases the lock; frames it then
//! appends are strictly newer than the replayed span). Per-terminal seq order and
//! the `attachRequestId` stamping from 3.10 are preserved: every frame a connection
//! receives is stamped with THAT connection's active `attachRequestId`.
//!
//! Transport-agnostic on purpose: a subscriber is a bare [`FrameSink`] callback, so
//! this crate keeps its no-tokio boundary (`freshell-ws` backs the sink with a tokio
//! mpsc sender feeding the socket).
