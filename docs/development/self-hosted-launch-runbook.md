# Self-hosted launch

Use the same flow for every Freshell machine. An instance is one Rust server
and one native Windows Electron client connected to it.

## Start or verify the server

Run this on the machine that owns the server:

```bash
cd /home/dan/code/freshell
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/health
```

If the health check fails, start the server with the canonical launcher:

```bash
scripts/launch-rust.sh --port 3001
```

For a remote machine, run the same command through SSH:

```bash
ssh <machine> 'cd /home/dan/code/freshell && scripts/launch-rust.sh --port 3001'
```

The launcher builds as needed and leaves a healthy instance running. Restarting
the live port requires explicit approval (`APPROVED`).

## Launch the native Windows client

Run this in a native Windows PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
$exe = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Freshell\Freshell.exe"
$profile = "$env:APPDATA\freshell-<server-id>"
Start-Process -FilePath $exe -ArgumentList "--user-data-dir=$profile"
```

Use a different `<server-id>` for each client whose Electron state should be
separate. The `--user-data-dir` argument selects the Electron/Chromium profile;
it does not select the Freshell server. The current desktop connection target
and token are shared outside that profile in
`%USERPROFILE%\.freshell\desktop.json`. Select or configure the target in
Freshell when prompted and verify that the client connected to the intended
server. Do not put tokens in the launch command.

## Verify the instance

Confirm that:

1. `GET /api/health` returns successfully on the server.
2. The native Windows Freshell window is visible.
3. The client is connected to the intended server, especially when more than
   one server is in use.
